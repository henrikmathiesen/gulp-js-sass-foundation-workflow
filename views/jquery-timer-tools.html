    <h1>jQuery Timer Tools</h1>
    <p>
        Throttle and Debounce are handy tools for controlling the intensity of callback functions triggered by events. We have allready
        looked at debounce in 'mobileScrolling' project, we have also used <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/v/5.5.3/javascript-utilities.html" target="_blank">Foundations tools (v5) for debounce and throttle</a>,
        but this time we are going to use a third party library with different tools. <mark>Foundation v5 gives us the same possibilities as lib bellow.</mark>

        <br>
        Installed via bower (see bower.json).

    <h2>Debounce</h2>
    <p>
        Execute a function
        <mark> only one time (even if we continously move mouse, event only fires once)</mark> within a time span specified in milliseconds.
        <br> There are two variants: 'execute at the begining of the time span' or 'execute at the end of the time span'.<br>
        Debouncing is often used to prevent an action from being performed twice, such as double clicking a submit button.
    </p>

    <h2>Throttle</h2>
    <p>
        Execute a function every n millisecond.<br>
        Throttling is often used in cases where itâ€™s disadvantageous to trigger a callback every time an event is triggered (during a continuous action), but you still want to trigger a reaction while the event is occurring.
